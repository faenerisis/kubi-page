        <p id="section-text">As a developer, I use JavaScript, C# and Python to create scripts and applications. As an IT Operations Support Specialist, I know ITIL processes, Linux, Atlassian, and Atlassian API. I can automate tasks with Jira and Power Automate. I'm eager to show my technical skills and creativity. At TurkNet, I completed a major project in my first year and received an appreciation letter from the CTO.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>As the IT Operations Support team, we ensured the continuous monitoring of TurkNet's IT assets 24/7, filtering out Disaster and High-level alarms to initiate and escalate necessary actions. Additionally, we maintained Uptime for IT assets, handled their reporting, and managed crisis situations.</li>
                        <li>Developed a Slack Bot integrated with Jira ITSM for TurkNet. Previously, TurkNet relied on Slack Channels for users to report problems in their CRM, but it was not a scalable solution. I took the initiative to create a better system and taught myself Node.js and bolt API. Slack Bot includes cron jobs to provide users with daily updates on the number of requests. I collaborated with the DevOps team and Dockerized the application, reducing the bot's maintenance efforts. I got an apperaction letter for this project from TurkNet CTO.</li>
                        <li>I created an API that connects Jira to Teams with Power automate to display dashboard data on Teams chat.</li>

                        <li>I developed the backend for a mobile food application that suggests recipes based on three skill levels. The core functionality of the application is powered by ChatGPT. For this project, I used Node.js, JSON, and the OpenAI API. The backend is responsible for processing user requests and interacting with the OpenAI API to generate recipe suggestions. The project never went live.</li>
